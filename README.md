How to compile and run the code?

1. To compile and run C code <br />
		$gcc --version <br />
		gcc (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0 <br />
		Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <br />

		warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. <br />

   Check if you get the gcc version installed on your machine. If not you need to install gcc first. <br />
   Assuming you've installed gcc already. <br />

		$gcc filename.c <br />
   
   Once you issued the above command, an executable file named a.out should be created in the present working directory. <br />
	
		$./a.out <br />
   To run the executable you will provide ./ followed by the executable file name. <br />

2. To compile and run JAVA code <br />
		$javac -version <br />
		$java -version <br />
   
   Check if you have both jdk and jre installed on you system. Once you have them installed issue the following commands. <br />

		$javac filename.java <br />
		$java classname <br />
		NOTE: The classname is same as the file name in which the java code is written. <br />
